# Mason's Wallpaper Collection

I have collected these wallpapers over a number of years and have no idea where I got most of them.  I have also renamed them all (giving them a number) so I don't even have their original filename. So I am in the process of uploading my entire wallpaper directory for those that want/need them.

## Where Did I Get These?

I find wallpapers in a number of different locations but good places to check out include [Imgur](http://imgur.com), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/), and [4chan](https://4chan.org/). Some of the wallpapers were probably included in default wallpaper packages from various GNU/Linux distributions that I have used over the years.

## Ownership

Because I downloaded most of these from sites like Imgur, Reddit, and 4chan I have no way of knowing if there is a copyright on these images.
